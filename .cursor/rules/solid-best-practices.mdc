- **SRP**: Ensure each class or function has a single responsibility. Break down large classes into smaller, focused ones.
- **OCP**: Design classes to be extensible without modification. Use interfaces and abstract classes for this purpose.
- **LSP**: Ensure subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **ISP**: Create specific interfaces rather than large, general ones. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **DIP**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Use dependency injection to manage dependencies.
